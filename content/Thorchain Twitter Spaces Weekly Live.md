# Notes:

* Chad (who is doxxed) is standing up against censorship and for freedom of speech.  Hot verbal altercation between Chad and Pluto (9R).
* Noticing more people running infra start to feel shaky after #tornadocash [US Treasury Sanctions Tornado Cash](news/US%20Treasury%20Sanctions%20Tornado%20Cash.md)
* Chad keeps bringing up great philosophical arguments.
* Pluto has a stance that sounds to me similar to go along to get along. Mentions that thorchain validators are all on cloud infrastructure.  Chad mentions that backing up TSS shares for validators can withstand even 100% of the network being removed from cloud infrastructure at once.
* Chad:  govt will never give permission.
* Pluto wants to see #thorchain working with #CBDC.  Clearly Chad has different opinion
* Jon Shapeshift: brings up that it is a slippery slope, if u dont add for instance privacy coins due to being afraid, what else will the community censor itself in due to fear
  * "Must build systems that WILL NOT AND CANNOT bend to anyones will - Jon Shapeshift"
* Chad mentions that Proof Of Work could be a way to handle censorship, possibly
* the "team" is widening and viewpoints are getting diversified.
* Chad and Pluto seem to increasingly disagree on philisophical vs pragmatic/practical
  -John: build it decentralized or someone else will
* ## Main Takeaway:  what is the next step for Thorchain decentralization?
