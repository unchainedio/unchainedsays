## TL;DR (TOO LONG DIDNT READ)

The Vatican is pulling in its purse strings.  The question to ask if you are the inquisitive type is, why is the Vatican ordering all its funds back into its own bank?

Bc, u cant default on yourself.  Not your bank, not your money.  Same concept as in crypto but on the nation state level.
