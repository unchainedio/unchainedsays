***Update (2127ET):*** President Biden gave an angry speech Thursday night in which he framed Republicans as election-denying 'extremists' who pose a threat to democracy and need to be fought tooth and nail.

Meanwhile, who thought this was a good aesthetic for the 'uniter in chief'?

With midterms right around the corner, President Biden is now **warning of the threat posed by "MAGA forces,"** according to excerpts published earlier on Thursday.

Biden's overall message, just days after he described Trump supporters as "ultra-MAGA Republicans" and "semi-fascists," will be that **democracy is at risk from Trumpism**.

"It’s not just Trump, it’s the entire philosophy that underpins the — I’m going to say something — **it’s like semi-fascism**," Biden said during a speech last week in Rockville, MD. "Trump and the extreme MAGA Republicans have made their choice: to go backward, full of anger, violence, hate and division. But we've chosen a different path: forward, the future, unity, hope and optimism."

So, that's the Democrats' messaging going into midterms - while they finalize a deal with Iran and the IRGC (officially a [terrorist organization](https://www.state.gov/foreign-terrorist-organizations/)) - that Republicans who aren't Liz Cheney or Adam Kinzinger are a threat to democracy.

Nevermind the 'mostly peaceful' riots staged every summer by Democrats and their Antifa foot-soldiers during every summer of Trump's presidency.
