# Hedge Fund Bears Capitulate, Unleashing Biggest Net Buying And Short Covering At Goldman Prime Since May | ZeroHedge

Ten days ago, when predicting why the current rally would continue indefinitely, we quoted Goldman which said that *"No One Is Positioned For Any Good News*" with the bank's Prime Brokerage also revealing that hedge fund tech shorts had hit a record, which to us ensured that this '[Most Hated Rally](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/funds-furious-powell-pours-gasoline-most-hated-rally-forcing-panic-buying)' would continue.

***We were right.***

But more remarkably, in subsequent days as the meltup got more acute, the bearish bias turned even more pronounced, and according to a Goldman Prime update last Friday, trading flows on the Prime book were "*definitively risk-off this week*" as Hedge funds actively unwound risk **every single day of the past week,** selling longs every day and covering shorts. Furthermore, according to the bank, not only dd global equities see de-grossing activity for a 3rd straight week, **but the week of August 1 "$ de-grossing – long sales and short covers combined – was the 2nd largest in the past 5 years (behind week ending 1/28/21 and marginally exceeding week ending 3/24/22) and ranks among the top 10 de-grossing weeks over the past decade; suggesting that HFs ramped up the pace of risk unwinds post the July FOMC and into US NFP on Fri/CPI data next week."**

This fascinating obstinate stubbornness by institutional investors and the "smart money" prompted us to predict that with "hedge funds keep waiting for the flush: net leverage at 1%-ile after last week's massive book unwind, means nobody is making money on the ramp" and "**at some point the capitulation will come."**

Well, surprise surprise, one day later we were proven right once again because as the market rally continued and broadened even further out (all SPX sectors closed up) post the CPI print yesterday, Goldman writes that "**the overall US Prime book saw the largest $ net buying in more than 3 months (1-Year Z score +1.8), driven by long buys as well as short covers."**

* *Macro Products (Index and ETF combined) made up 66% of the $ net buying (Z score +1.8), driven by short covers and long buys (1.3 to 1 ratio). US-listed ETF shorts saw net covering of -2.2% (flat WoW), led by covers in Small Cap Equip, Large Cap Equity, and Credit ETFs*
* *Net buying in Single Stocks was relatively more muted (Z score +1.0), driven by long buys and short covers (1.3 to 1 ratio). Info Tech, Consumer Disc, Financials were the most $ net bought, while Real Estate, Comm Svcs, Health Care, and Staples were the most $ net sold.*

The bearish capitulation took place just as the shorters tapped out, and GS Prime notes that "while price of the GS Most Short basket (GSCBMSAL) outperformed and rallied +5.1% yesterday, **shorts across the basket’s constituents on the Prime book only saw modest net covering of -0.3% (vs. - 0.4% for all single stock shorts).**" In other words, most hedge funds caught offside with an overweight bearish position, have already hit their max pain level and covered.

Now, naturally, if stubborn bearishness by the fast money crowd is why we have been uncharacteristically bullish in the past month, the fact that we have finally reached capitulation should make us cautious, and indeed starting tomorrow we would gradually fade any upside momentum, especially if the S&P closes above the previously-discussed 50 Fib retracement which is seen by many as validating that this was not just a bear market rally (this time will be different).

[![](https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/ES%202022-08-11_15-23-04_0.jpg?itok=hTW6p2aQ)](https://www.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/ES%202022-08-11_15-23-04_0.jpg?itok=hTW6p2aQ)

To be sure, while capitulation may have begun it will continue for quite some time, especially with CTAs, buybacks and retail still chasing the upside. Meaning that "topping" will be process and not a one-day sharp reversal that proceeds to immediately plunge afterward (unless the Fed shocks markets with an intermeeting rate hike).  The real question is how long until the last bear is forced to cover. That might take a while as the following data points from Goldman's John Flood suggest:

 > 
 > **CTA:** short term (3999), medium term (4134) and long term (4082) momentum all firmly in positive territory. CTAs have now fully covered S&P shorts (bought $12b over the last week) and are now long $3.4b S&P. With sharp move higher today we have CTAs buying an additional ~11b S&P over the next 5 days. The max S&P long position we have seen CTA community build in our historical data is ~$50b.
 > 
 > **Corporate Buybacks:** We estimate 92% of the S&P 500 are in open window by the end of the week. Our buyback desk is ACTIVE today running at 1.4x 2021’s daily avg notional executed. $1.1T in corporate executions this year (most ever) looking like a very real possibility
 > 
 > **Liquidity:** the impact of "non-fundamental demand" continues to be exacerbated by very poor liquidity. Top of Book in S&P finished yday at $9.96mm (38th percentile over the last 5 years).

In other words, for those planning on reshorting asap, be very careful: as Flood concludes:

 > 
 > "**I firmly believe this move higher continues to be a lack of supply** (more so than explosion on demand side). **We DO NOT have HFs reshorting this pop today which is noteworthy. HF buyskew across our floor is +13%...highest since 5/30/22 and in the 95th percentile on 52 week look back**. Incremental sellers remain incredibly difficult to identify in this tape (let alone draw out). **I think this dynamic essentially rings true for remainder of August and then we can come back to the drawing board post labor day**. **S&P’s 50% retracement, using YTD highs vs YTD lows = 4228... keep on your radar. Next true technical level of resistance after that I see is S&P’s 200dma all the way up at 4332."**

And here, we have one additional valuable detail: according to GS Prime, whereas Info Tech stocks saw the largest $ net buying since 6/24 (Z score +1.1), driven by IT Services and Software, as shown in the chart below, **the sector's weighting vs. the SPX fell to fresh 10-year lows yesterday (5.4% U/W), confirming hedge funds have been highly reluctant to chase the rally**.

In other words, only once we see a return of the frenzied stampede into tech, would we turn all out bearish. Until then, expect a modest grind higher, but - now that levered bearish hedge funds have thrown in the towel - with far more risks to the downside than in recent weeks.
