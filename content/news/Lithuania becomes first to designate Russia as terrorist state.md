Lithuania's parliament on Tuesday designated Russia as a terrorist country and recognized its actions in Ukraine as genocide.

**Why it matters:** In doing so, Lithuania has become the first country in the world to designate Russia as a sponsor and executor of terrorism, Ukraine's [Centre for Strategic Communications and Information Security](https://twitter.com/StratcomCentre/status/1523966501690163207?s=20&t=ssOkBXXaFvKCiGnq8898uA) tweeted.

**State of play:** Lithuania's unicameral parliament adopted the two-pronged resolution unanimously, per a [statement posted to its Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/100069161321321/posts/310397591275616/?d=n).

* "The war against Ukraine by the Russian Federation is a genocide of the Ukrainian nation carried out by Russia. The Russian Federation is a country that supports and executes terrorism," the statement read.

**What they're saying:** The resolution stated that Russian forces have committed war crimes in Ukrainian cities such as Bucha, Irpin, Mariupol, Borodyanka and Hostomel, [Lithuanian National Radio and Television](https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1691202/lithuania-recognises-war-in-ukraine-as-genocide-russia-as-terrorist-state) (LRT) reported.

* The parliament "recognizes the full-scale armed aggression – war – against Ukraine by the armed forces of the Russian Federation and its political and military leadership ... as genocide against the Ukrainian people," it added.
* The resolution also stated that Russia, "whose military forces deliberately and systematically target civilian targets, is a state that supports and perpetrates terrorism."

**The big picture:** Last week, Ukraine's Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova told the U.S. Helsinki Commission that Russia had committed [nearly 10,000 war crimes](https://www.axios.com/2022/05/05/ukraine-invasion-venediktova-russia-war-crimes) over the course of the war.

* Russian forces have deliberately [targeted civilian infrastructure](https://www.axios.com/2022/03/13/unicef-unfpa-who-health-facility-ukraine) such as hospitals.
* Last month, Sima Bahous, the United Nations executive director for women, told the UN Security Council that [reports of human trafficking](https://www.axios.com/2022/04/12/attacks-ukrainian-women-children-un), rape and other sexual violence in Ukraine were increasing.
* President Biden said last month that Russia was [committing genocide in Ukraine](https://www.axios.com/2022/04/12/biden-putin-genocide-ukraine).

Russian President Vladimir Putin railed against NATO as he spent much of his Victory Day speech in Moscow on Monday trying to justify [his troops' invasion of Ukraine](https://www.axios.com/2022/02/22/russia-ukraine-invasion-putin-live-updates), per multiple reports.

**Why it matters:** Putin didn't use his Victory Day speech to officially declare war on Ukraine or fully mobilize Russia's reservists, as some Western officials feared he would.

A Ukrainian official said Tuesday that at least 44 bodies were found and pulled out from under the debris of a five-story building in Izyum, Ukraine, that Russian forces destroyed in March.

**What they're saying:** "This is another horrible war crime of the Russian occupiers against the civilian population!" Oleh Synehubov, the governor of the Kharkiv region that includes Izyum, [wrote in a post on Telegram](https://t.me/synegubov/3159).
