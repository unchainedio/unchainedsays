A 29-year-old unnamed developer, who is suspected of being involved in the sanctioned Tornado Cash protocol, was arrested in Amsterdam on Friday, according to a [release](https://www.fiod.nl/arrest-of-suspected-developer-of-tornado-cash/) by the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD).

* Tornado Cash is an Ethereum blockchain-based [crypto mixing service](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/bitcoin-mixers-how-do-they-work-and-why-are-they-used/) that allows users to gain a cloak of anonymity when transferring crypto assets. On Monday, the service was [sanctioned](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/08/crypto-mixing-service-tornado-cash-blacklisted-by-us-treasury/) by the U.S. government for assisting criminals in laundering stolen money.

* The suspect will be brought before an examining judge in Den Bosch, a city in the Netherlands, at 11:30 local time on Friday, the FIOD told CoinDesk.

* FIOD, which began its investigation in June, said it hasn't ruled out making multiple arrests in the case. Dutch prosecutors are investigating the matter on suspicions of fraud, environmental crime and asset confiscation.

* FIOD is also giving "extra attention" to decentralized autonomous organizations that my facilitate money laundering, the agency told CoinDesk.

***UPDATE (Aug 12, 11:30 UTC)**\_\_: Adds that suspect will be brought before a judge and that FIOD is looking at DAOs.*
