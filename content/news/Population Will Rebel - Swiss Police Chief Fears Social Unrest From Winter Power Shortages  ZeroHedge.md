# "Population Will Rebel" - Swiss Police Chief Fears Social Unrest From Winter Power Shortages | ZeroHedge

The Swiss government is preparing rapidly for the possibility of power shortages this winter with Jan Flückiger, Secretary General of the Energy Directors' Conference, warning that **"internal security then becomes a problem,"** arguing that **the federal government has not yet recognized the urgency in this regard.**

In an interview with [Swiss German-language daily newspaper Blick](https://www.blick.ch/politik/oberster-polizeidirektor-fredy-faessler-63-besorgt-ueber-moeglichen-stromausfall-es-ist-denkbar-dass-die-bevoelkerung-rebelliert-id17804669.html), **Fredy Fässler, the Police Chief of one of Switzerland's largest Cantons, warned that people may revolt and resort to looting if the Alpine nation is hit by a severe energy crunch this winter.**

 > 
 > *“Imagine, you can no longer withdraw money at the ATM, you can no longer pay with the card in the store or refuel your tank at the gas station. **Heating stops working. It’s cold. Streets go dark. It is conceivable that the population would rebel or that there would be looting,**” he said, adding that the country’s authorities should take measures to prepare for such extreme scenarios.*

Exercises that were conducted in 2014 to prepare for a blackout scenario revealed major shortcomings, including lack of emergency generators for police, hospitals and other critical infrastructure and services, he said.

 > 
 > *“These shortcomings have been corrected in recent years," the police chief noted, adding rather ominously that **now "the security forces are armed" and his agency is even prepared to provide the Swiss with cash** if they are unable to use cards in stores, given that relevant agreements with banks have been signed.*

Additionally, Fässler **warned of looting:**

 > 
 > *"I don't want to paint the devil on the wall, but it has also been seen in environmental disasters that **certain people have abused the situation to plunder unprotected objects.** This could also be the case if the network is switched off, for example in shops where there is something to buy."*

But he **warned the federal government not to over-step its tyrannical orders** pre-emptively and expected police support:

 > 
 > *"I appeal to the federal government to **only order measures that can be implemented** and, above all, controlled. **We certainly won't become the sauna police.**"*

[Earlier](https://www.rt.com/news/561220-switzerland-revolt-energy-deficit-police/), Werner Luginbuhl, the head of Switzerland’s electricity regulator ElCom, complained that **electricity was being used “*completely thoughtlessly*,” and [urged citizens to stock up on candles and firewood](https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/google-searches-firewood-germany-have-exploded)** due to possible power outages in the country this winter.

There has been a [surge in searches in Switzerland for 'brennholz' (firewood)](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=CH&q=brennholz)...

Fãssler’s comments come after Swiss authorities said last week that they may place restrictions on energy consumption this coming winter, signaling that **“power shortages \[are\] among the most serious risks” for the landlocked country.**

This is Swiss officials warning of revolt and urging its people to gather firewood... not central Parisian leaders or Baltimore politicians!!!
