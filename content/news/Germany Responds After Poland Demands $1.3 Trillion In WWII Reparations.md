Germany has responded after Poland demanded **$1.32 trillion** in reparations over losses suffered during WWII.

On Thursday, Poland's Deputy Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski said that Warsaw would officially demand reparations from its **largest trade partner** and a fellow member of both the EU and NATO.

"The sum that was presented was adopted using the most limited, conservative method, it would be possible to increase it," said Kaczynski, leader of Poland's Law and Justice (PiS) party during a news conference. "**Germany has never really accounted for its crimes against Poland**," he added.

Kaczynski - who is Poland's chief policy maker, and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, attended a ceremonial release of a long-awaited reparations report held at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, which was rebuilt from wartime ruins.

**Germany hit back** in a statement from its foreign ministry, **which said that the question of reparations was 'concluded' long ago** with Poland renouncing further claims, and that the German position that compensation was paid to East Bloc nations in the years after the war, has not changed.

Poland's combative stance towards Germany has intensified after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

In 1953, Poland's then-communist rulers **relinquished all claims to reparations** amid pressure from the USSR, which wanted to free the soviet satellite of East Germany from any liabilities. According to Poland, **the agreement is invalid because Poland was unable to negotiate fair compensation**, according to *Reuters*.

 > *Donald Tusk, leader of Poland's biggest opposition party Civic Platform, said on Thursday that Kaczynski's announcement was "not about reparations".*
 > 
 > *"**It's about an internal political campaign to rebuild support for the ruling party**," he said.*

Germany's top official for German-Polish cooperation, Dietmar Nietan, said in a statement that Sept. 1 "remains a day of guilt and shame for Germany that reminds us time and again not to forget the crimes carried out by Germany" that are the "darkest chapter in our history."
