# Trump Campaign Refused Ashley Biden Diary, Told Suspects To Give To FBI | ZeroHedge

---

---

Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign **rejected an offer to buy [the diary](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/two-plead-guilty-stealing-ashley-bidens-inappropriate-showers-dad-diary) of President Joe Biden's daughter**, Ashley, and instead urged the would-be sellers to surrender it to the FBI.

As [*Just the News*](https://justthenews.com/government/courts-law/trump-campaign-turned-down-ashley-biden-diary-urged-suspects-give-it-fbi) notes, court filings from the Southern District of New York reveal that Aimee Harris and Robert Kurtlander - who pleaded guilty to stealing the diary (which Ashley Biden left behind at a friend's house in Delray Beach, FL).

"On or about September 6, 2020, AIMEE HARRIS and ROBERT KURLANDER, the defendants, attended a political fundraiser in Florida meant to benefit the campaign of an individual \[Trump\] who was running for office against \[now-President Joe Biden\]. HARRIS and KURLANDER attended the fundraiser with the intent of showing the Victim's stolen property to a campaign representative of \[Trump\], hoping that the political campaign would purchase it," read the filings.

"On or about September 10, 2020, a representative of \[Trump's\] political campaign conveyed to AIMEE HARRIS and ROBERT KURLANDER, the defendants, that **the campaign was not interested in purchasing the property and advised HARRIS and KURLANDER to provide the items to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI')**," the document continues. "KURLANDER texted HARRIS, "\[Trump\] campaign can't use it. They want it to go to the FBI. There is NO WAY \[Trump\] can use this. It has to be done a different way."

So - more or less the opposite of paying a British spy to fabricate salacious lies and covertly spread them to the FBI and the media.

As we noted [on Thursday](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/two-plead-guilty-stealing-ashley-bidens-inappropriate-showers-dad-diary),

Aimee Harris, 40, and Robert Kurlander, 58, admitted they took part in a [conspiracy to transport stolen materials](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/florida-residents-plead-guilty-conspiracy-commit-interstate-transportation-stolen) from Florida, where Ashley Biden had been living, to New York, according to the [*New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/25/us/politics/ashley-biden-diary-project-veritas-guilty.html).

"Harris and Kurlander stole personal property from an immediate family member of a candidate for national political office," said Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.

The pair eventually sold the diary to *Project Veritas,* which declined to publish it (and were **still [raided](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/fbi-raids-project-veritas-staffer-probe-over-biden-daughters-diary)** by the Biden DOJ). [On Oct. 24, 2020](https://nationalfile.com/exclusive-source-biden-daughters-diary-details-not-appropriate-showers-with-joe-as-child/), *National File* published excerpts - and the full diary two days later. While treated as potentially fake at the time, **we now know that the contents are legit** - including claims that Joe took 'probably inappropriate' showers with Ashley, and that she believes she was **sexually molested as a child**.

What are the odds that ***both*** Biden kids abandoned evidence that would be highly damaging to their father in the runup to the 2020 election, forcing the intelligence community and the MSM to coordinate massive damage control campaigns?
