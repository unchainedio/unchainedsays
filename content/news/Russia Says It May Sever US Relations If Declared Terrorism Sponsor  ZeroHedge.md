# Russia Says It May Sever US Relations If Declared Terrorism Sponsor | ZeroHedge

---

---

A Russian diplomat warned that if his country is declared a state sponsor of terr**orism, it could not only harm US-Russo relations but potentially sever them completely.** 

On Friday, Alexander Darchiyev, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry's North American department told the [TASS](https://tass.com/politics/1493051) news agency: 

 > 
 > "I would like to mention the legislative initiative currently being discussed in Congress to declare Russia a 'country sponsor of terrorism.' If passed, it would mean that Washington would have to cross the point of no return, **with the most serious collateral damage to bilateral diplomatic relations, up to their lowering or even breaking them off. *The US side has been warned***."

Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) have been leading an effort to pressure the Biden administration into making the terror designation, which would allow new categories of sanctions. The are only four designated countries today: Cuba, North Korea, Iran and Syria. 

**On July 28, the Senate passed a non-binding resolution** calling on Secretary of State Antony Blinken to designate the Russian Federation as a state sponsor of terrorism. At the time, [Graham said](https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=9CD80923-FC0A-4A7B-ADCF-497C6E26F8BB) this about a potential designation:

 > 
 > "It means that doing business with Russia with that designation gets to be exceedingly hard – it has secondary effect sanctions, it would limit dual export items, and more importantly **it would waive sovereign immunity when it came to suing Russia in U.S. courts. This designation would be a nightmare for Russia."**

Blinken, however, has said a terror designation [wouldn't change things much](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/29/us/politics/russia-terrorism-blinken.html): "The costs that have been imposed on Russia by us and by other countries are absolutely in line with the consequences that would follow from designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.”

**On Thursday, the Latvian parliament made its own terror-sponsor designation of Russia.** "Latvia recognizes Russia's actions in Ukraine as targeted genocide against the Ukrainian people," [declared](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/latvia-designates-russia-state-sponsor-terrorism-over-ukraine-war-2022-08-11/) the legislature's resolution.  

"A timely move," [tweeted](https://twitter.com/DmytroKuleba/status/1557656834919616514?s=20&t=sjD7Cd-ykzFvLiFQPqSdFw) Ukraine foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba. "Russia has long deserved this status with its actions in Ukraine and beyond. Ukraine encourages other states and organizations to follow suit."  

As we [wrote](https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/nuke-deal-breakthrough-iran-drops-demand-irgc-be-removed-terror-list) in June, "**the U.S. government's application of terrorist designations has been impulsively disingenuous to the point that it saps the label of any meaning apart from the financial consequences.** In practice, terror designations are just another means of bludgeoning countries that are out of favor with the U.S. government."

Designating Russia a state sponsor of terror over a conventional military invasion would represent just the latest bastardization of the term. Indeed, **if the terror label were attached to every invasion that's accompanied by alleged war crimes, the U.S. government would have to designate itself.**
