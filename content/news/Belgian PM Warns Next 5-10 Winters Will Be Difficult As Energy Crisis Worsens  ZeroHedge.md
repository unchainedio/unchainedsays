# Belgian PM Warns "Next 5-10 Winters Will Be Difficult" As Energy Crisis Worsens | ZeroHedge

---

---

Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo might have spilled the beans about the duration of Europe's energy crisis. He told reporters Monday, **"the next 5 to 10 winters will be difficult."** 

"The development of the situation is **very difficult throughout Europe**," De Croo told Belgium broadcaster VRT. 

 > 
 > *"In a number of sectors, it is **really difficult to deal with those high energy prices**. We are monitoring this closely, but we must be transparent: the **coming months will be difficult**, the **coming winters will be difficult**," he said.* 

The prime minister's comments suggest replacing Russian natural gas imports could take years, exerting further [economic doom](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/winter-coming-europe-stagflation-and-energy-crises-are-set-bite) on the region's economy in the form of energy hyperinflation.

Europe faces a historic energy crisis exacerbated by Russia's war in Ukraine (and Western sanctions that have backfired). The continent heavily relies on Russia for its energy needs, importing about 40% of NatGas. At just 20% capacity with [risks of going to zero next month](https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/eu-natgas-soars-record-high-gazprom-announces-new-halt-flows), Russian supplies via Gazprom's Nord Stream 1 have sent NatGas and power prices to record highs this week. 

European NatGas prices soared to a record high of 277 euros per megawatt-hour on Monday, about 15 times the average summertime price. Leon Izbicki, a commodity analyst at Energy Aspects Ltd., told Bloomberg if NS1 flows come to a halt in September, prices could rise to 400 euros per megawatt-hour.

Bloomberg's commodities reporter Javier Blas tweeted a map of day-ahead electricity prices across Europe. He called the prices "eye-watering, with lots of countries setting record highs for today." 

The shift from Russian NatGas supplies has backfired for the 19-nation eurozone. Germany, Europe's largest economy, could be headed for a [recession](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/miserable-german-retail-sales-crash-most-record-europe-slumps-recession) that will bring down the rest of the continent. 

De Croo said Belgium and the eurozone must "support each other in these difficult times."

Europe's dark winter could be a yearly occurrence throughout this decade if the prime minister is right. The widely optimistic idea that the bloc could replace all Russian Natgas imports this year was a farce, and now European households must pay exorbitantly high power costs, forcing millions into [energy poverty](https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/uk-energy-execs-tell-mps-fuel-poverty-crush-households-debt). 

Even though Germany admitted that it was a terrible mistake to become so dependent on cheap Russian energy -- like a drug -- how long does it take for Berlin to go back to its dealer \[Moscow\] for resupplies and defect from the rest of Europe because it doesn't want to freeze to death this winter nor crash its economy.
