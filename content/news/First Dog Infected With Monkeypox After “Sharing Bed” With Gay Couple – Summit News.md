**A dog has been infected with monkeypox for the first time ever after sharing a bed with a gay couple in Paris and subsequently being found suffering from an “anal ulceration.”**

Well, this is awkward.

“Two gay men living in Paris developed monkeypox symptoms at the start of June and went to a hospital, where their lesions were identified as being caused by the disease,” reports the Telegraph.

“The non-exclusive couple, aged 44 and 27-years-old, developed sore lesions in their anal region as well as over the rest of their body a week after having sex with other men.”

12 days after the couple reported to hospital suffering symptoms of monkeypox, their four-year-old male Italian greyhound was found to have also developed lesions and pustules on the stomach.

Media reports about the issue suggested the infection happened merely as a result of the dog being in close proximity to the infected couple and didn’t dwell on the fact that the dog was also suffering from “anal ulceration.”

In other words, in all probability, knowing they were infected with monkeypox, the gay couple had engaged in anal sex with their own dog.

Lovely stuff.

“A PCR test revealed the dog had monkeypox, and genetic sequencing found it was a 100 per cent match to the strain that infected his owners, indicating the dog caught the virus from his owners.”

As we previously highlighted, the spread of monkeypox is almost entirely down to gay men having sex with each other, with early outbreaks being traced back to a gay sauna in Spain and a fetish festival in Belgium.

Earlier this month, infectious disease experts in Sweden [criticized](https://summit.news/2022/08/03/health-experts-sound-monkeypox-alarm-on-swedens-gay-pride-march/) the country’s gay pride parade organizers for failing to provide any information on monkeypox ahead of a march that they warn could be a ‘super spreader’ event.

The World Health Organization recently said that cases continue to spread amongst “men who have sex with men,” although after saying summer festivals should be limited, they later [clarified](https://summit.news/2022/05/31/who-says-gay-pride-events-should-go-ahead-despite-monkeypox-threat/) that gay pride events should go ahead as normal.

After health authorities in San Francisco issued a public health emergency over monkeypox, gay men were still encouraged to attend the annual pride parade as well as sex orgies.

## Just 29 of 142 NHS Hospitals Refer to Pregnancy as Exclusively Biological Female Issue

Others use terms like “birthing people” or “pregnant people.”

**A Freedom of Information Act request has revealed that just 29 of the 124 NHS hospitals in England with maternity units still exclusively use the words “woman” or “mother” to refer to pregnancy, while all the others include terms such as “birthing people” or “pregnant people.”**

The FOIA request, filed by the Daily Mail, also found that 15 out of that remaining 29 are considering changing their language to pander to woke transgender lobbyists.

That would leave just 14 maternity units in the entire country that still refer to pregnancy by solely referring to biological women.

Despite refusing to acknowledge whether or not a single one of their patients has identified as anything other than a woman, Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals told the newspaper that they use the phrase “women and birthing people” in order to be as “inclusive and representative as possible.”

Liverpool Women’s Hospital admitted that it has never recorded a single transgender patient using their maternity services, but went ahead and gave its language a woke makeover anyway.

Meanwhile, hospitals in Southampton are tactically avoiding the word “woman” entirely by describing the process in the second person as “you” and “your pregnancy.”

The NHS, celebrated by the left as some kind of religious institution, is virtually beyond criticism in the UK despite the fact that it is notoriously unfit for purpose.

As we [highlighted](https://summit.news/2022/06/29/nhs-removes-references-to-women-from-advice-about-menopause/) back in June, the NHS caused controversy by erasing all references to women from an online advice section about the menopause, an exclusively female condition.

During the same month, which by no coincidence was also ‘Pride Month’, the NHS website [altered](https://summit.news/2022/06/08/report-uks-nhs-scrubs-the-word-women-from-ovarian-cancer-guidance-to-be-more-inclusive/) its guidance pages on ovarian cancer, removing instances of the word “women” in a move that sources said was intended to be more “inclusive” toward trans, non-binary and intersex people.

NHS hospitals have started asking clearly male patients if they are pregnant before procedures in order to pander to woke language policing, while the term “breastfeeding” has been changed to “chestfeeding” in some instances.

And all this is funded by the taxpayer!

## Twitter Bans Women Who Complained About ‘Transgender’ Rugby Player Competing Against 16-Year-Old Girls

Respect the pronouns.

**After a biological male in his 30’s who identifies as a transgender woman was allowed to compete in a Gaelic soccer final against 16-year-old girls, women who complained about it had their accounts banned by Twitter.**

The transgender in question, Giulia Valentino, is a balding man who moved to Dublin from Italy and has previously advocated for women’s sport to allow transgenders to compete as well as complaining about not being able to use female changing rooms.

As the image above shows, Valentino clearly has an unfair physical advantage over the female players yet was allowed to compete anyway for Na Gaeil Aeracha, which describes itself as Ireland’s “first explicitly LGBTQ+ inclusive” football club.

After Na Gaeil Aeracha won the 2022 Junior J Shield tournament with ease, critics were censored for questioning Valentino’s involvement.

“I think it is preposterous. Twitter clearly has its own agenda and considers this to be hate speech. Utterly bonkers,” one woman told the Daily Mail.

“Seemingly many individuals have had their accounts locked or suspended by merely pointing out a scientific truth.”

Some had their accounts locked, but many were banned outright for calling Valentino a man.

“The women who have been suspended from Twitter are the latest in a long line of women – and some men – who have been banned from the social media platform for stating the truth,” said Women’s Right Network’s Heather Binning.

Another person expressed concern that Valentino could have even hurt the other girls, given his clearly dominant physicality.

“I quit team sports when I started feeling uncomfortable with the male environment… Actually, I am playing rugby with a women’s team, and it is my first team experience after the transition,” Valentino previously stated.

However, there is no evidence that he has actually had any transition surgery.

According to Reduxx, “Valentino performs at fetish clubs under the moniker DJ Mav and identifies himself as a “trans dyke.”

![null](https://reduxx.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Untitled-design-8-1-1024x528.png)

“Many of the photos on Valentino’s social media are of him in explicit fetish gear, or posing on stripper poles or in highly sexual venues.”

Naturally, who could have expected anything else?

As we previously [highlighted](https://summit.news/2022/06/22/another-sport-bans-trans/), back in June, Rugby’s international governing body banned transgender athletes from competing in women’s matches.

Gee, I wonder why?

## Counselor For Sex Offenders Defends “Minor-Attracted Persons”

Suggests pedophilia should be accepted as a normal sexual preference.

**A counselor for sex offenders who works with the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections has stoked controversy after defending “minor attracted persons” and comparing pedophilia to a normal sexual preference.**

In a video posted to YouTube that has since been clipped and posted to Twitter, Miranda Galbreath describes adults who are sexually attracted to children as “probably the most vilified population of folks in our culture.”

“The term pedophile has moved from being a diagnostic label to being a judgmental, hurtful insult that we hurl at people in order to harm them or slander them,” Galbreath insisted.

“I also like to use person-first language that recognizes that any label we apply to a person is only part of who they are and doesn’t represent everything that they are,” she added.

Asserting that “many minor-attracted persons never act on their attraction,” Galbreath complained that saying mean things about would-be child molesters is harmful to an “already marginalized population.”

Galbreath sought to remove agency from pedophiles, suggesting that their sickness isn’t their own fault and that their sexual perversions should be accepted on the same level as heterosexuality or homosexuality.

“\[Minor-attracted person\] simply means that the person has an enduring sexual or romantic attraction to minors. They have not chosen this attraction, just as the rest of us have not chosen whatever our attraction is,” Galbreath said.

“You don’t get to choose to be heterosexual or to be gay or whatever you are, and you don’t get to choose to be a minor-attracted person,” she added.

According to Galbreath’s website, she has 20 years of experience working in the mental health field and also conducts “evaluation and treatment services in the community and within state prisons to folks who have committed sexual offenses,” including for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections.

The video clip is yet another illustration of the end game of sexual progressivism – the absorption of pedophilia under the LGBTQ+ umbrella.

The exposure of children to this movement is clearly part of a long term plan by perverts and groomers to force society to accept their deranged behavior as normal.

The direction of travel suggests that in the near future, pedophilia will be judged as merely another sexual preference to be tolerated and even promoted by culture and society.

Critics will likely be branded ‘pedophobes’ and face condemnation, deplatforming and ritual public shaming.

What a wonderful world awaits us all.
