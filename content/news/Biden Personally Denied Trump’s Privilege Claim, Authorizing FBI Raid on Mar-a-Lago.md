# Biden Personally Denied Trump’s Privilege Claim, Authorizing FBI Raid on Mar-a-Lago

---

*Also seen on [ZeroHedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2022-08-23/fbi-had-blessing-biden-mar-lago-raid).*

*Before getting into this, I just want to state: I’m no fan of Trump. He deficit spent like no other, pressured the Federal Reserve to goose the stock and housing markets driving wealth inequality even further, gave hundreds of billions to Big Pharma to create a shitty vaccine that the subsequent administration then used to oppress and ostracize the working class, and bombed the shit out of the Middle East. That said, I prefer him to any of the last five presidents and believe a sitting President wielding law enforcement agencies to persecute political opponents should make everyone uneasy regardless of whom its used against.*

Ok, now that that’s out of the way…

Jon Solomon’s *Just the News* recently [obtained](https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/all-things-trump/biden-white-house-facilitated-dojs-criminal-probe-against-trump?utm_source=sf&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=twjs) a letter between National Archivist Debra Stiedel Wall and Trump’s legal team showing Biden’s tacit support for the FBI’s investigation into Trump. 

**The documents in question had been examined by and temporarily in possession of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) as early as January of 2022**, when they “arranged for the transport from the Trump Mar-a-Lago property in Florida to the National Archives of 15 boxes that contained Presidential records, following discussions with President Trump’s representatives in 2021,” [according](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/national-archives-says-trump-took-15-boxes-white-house-records-florida-rcna15260) to NBC News. 

Then in April, presumably after returning these materials back into Trump’s possession, Wall writes Trump’s defense attorney Evan Corcoran, “In its initial review of materials within those boxes, NARA identified items marked as classified national security information.” Wall then informs Corcoran that the FBI would like access to the documents. **Given the supposed sensitivity of the documents, it seems strange that NARA returned them to Trump before completing their review.** Cocoran requested time to determine whether Trump intended to exercise executive privilege on specified materials.

**"We have requested the ability to review the documents,"** Corcoran wrote to both NARA and White House Deputy Counsel on April 29. “We would respectfully request that you restrict access to the documents until we have had the opportunity to review the documents and to **consult with President Donald J. Trump so that he may personally make any decision to assert a claim of constitutionally based privilege.”**

According to *Just the News*, “Wall informed Corcoran that she had the blessing of Biden to overrule those privilege claims and share all materials requested by the DOJ and FBI.”

From the letter: "The Counsel to the President has informed me that, in light of the particular circumstances presented here, **President Biden defers to my determination**, in consultation with the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, regarding whether or not I should uphold the former President's purported 'protective assertion of executive privilege,'" Wall wrote. **"... I have therefore decided not to honor the former President's 'protective' claim of privilege."**

Here’s WH Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre a day after the raid:

(*Cue the Curb Your Enthusiasm Theme)*

**Wall’s claim that Biden deferred to her judgment is odd considering that, on the same day, Wall herself was contacted by White House Counsel member Dana Remus stating “The President has determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not in the best interests of the United States, and therefore is not justified.”** That [letter](https://www.archives.gov/files/foia/remus-letter-to-wall-re-trump-03.08.2022-privilege-letter-re-january-6-request.05.10.2022.pdf) is available thanks to a FOIA request (not sure who filed for it but luckily Google has yet to scrub it from the top search results):

Why Wall told Trump’s team that it was her decision is a mystery. Could this be related to Dana Remus’s [departure](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/15/1104920806/dana-remus-made-legal-history-in-the-white-house-now-shes-moving-on) from the WH Counsel Office just one month later? Did Remus f\*\*\* up by revealing it was Biden’s decision?

Shortly after Wall’s letter was sent, the DOJ issued a subpoena prompting the FBI to visit Mar-a-Lago on June 3 who were [granted](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fbi-seizes-privileged-trump-records-during-raid-doj-opposes-request-independent-review-sources) access voluntarily by Trump. The FBI seized a portion of the materials and instructed Trump to lock the remaining boxes in a storage room, an order Trump complied with according to a Fox News source.

A quick reminder that when Hillary Clinton was subpoenaed to produce the contents of her private email server, her response was far from compliant. **She [denied](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-emails_n_7756106) ever receiving a subpoena, told the FBI she [could not locate](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hillary-clinton-smash-phone-hammer/) any of the requested 13 mobile devices, [deleted](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-deleted-33000-emails-secretary-state/story?id=42389308) 33,000 emails from her personal server, and [joked](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hillary-clinton-jokes-wiping-email-server-cloth/story?id=33165517) about all of this publicly!** Somehow this behavior did not result in a search warrant and raid of her summer home in Chappaqua, NY.

Can you imagine if Trump had burned the documents after learning of the subpoena and claiming to have ‘misplaced’ them?
