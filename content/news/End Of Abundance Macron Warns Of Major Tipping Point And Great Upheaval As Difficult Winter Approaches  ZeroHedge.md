# "End Of Abundance": Macron Warns Of "Major Tipping Point" And "Great Upheaval" As Difficult Winter Approaches | ZeroHedge

---

With much of Europe facing a cold winter thanks to the war in Ukraine, **various leaders have been sounding the alarm over the 'sacrifices' people are going to have to make** in order to maintain opposition to Vladimir Putin - who's betting on fracturing the EU due to Russia's immense leverage over energy.

On Wednesday we reported that that both **EU policy Chief [Josep Borrell](https://www.zerohedge.com/energy/weary-europeans-must-bear-consequences-ukraine-war-putin-will-eventually-blink-eus-borrell)** warned that "wary" EU populations would have to endure deep economic pain and a severe energy crunch - while calling on the citizenry to "bear the consequences" with continued resolve.

The same day, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo **[went much further](https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/belgian-pm-warns-next-5-10-winters-will-be-difficult-energy-crisis-worsens) - suggesting that "the next 5 to 10 winters will be difficult."**

"The development of the situation is **very difficult throughout Europe**," De Croo told Belgium broadcaster VRT.

 > *"In a number of sectors, it is **really difficult to deal with those high energy prices**. We are monitoring this closely, but we must be transparent: the **coming months will be difficult**, the **coming winters will be difficult**," he said.* 

The prime minister's comments suggest replacing Russian natural gas imports could take years, exerting further [economic doom](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/winter-coming-europe-stagflation-and-energy-crises-are-set-bite) on the region's economy in the form of energy hyperinflation.

And in *yet another* ominous warning in what must have been coordinated messaging, **French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday went *even further***  - warning at his first cabinet meeting after the summer holidays that the French should expect to make deep sacrifices in what he called the "**end of abundance**."

Speaking before ministers at the Élysée, Macron said that the country was at a "tipping point" as it faced a **difficult winter** **and a new era of instability** due to climate change and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to [*The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/24/macron-warns-of-end-of-abundance-as-france-faces-difficult-winter).

"**What we are currently living through is a kind of major tipping point or a great upheaval** … we are living the end of what could have seemed an era of abundance … the end of the abundance of products of technologies that seemed always available … the end of the abundance of land and materials including water," he said, adding that France and the French felt that they've been living under a series of crises, "each worse than the last."

"This overview that I’m giving, the end of abundance, the end of insouciance, the end of assumptions – it’s ultimately a tipping point that we are going through that can lead our citizens to feel a lot of anxiety. Faced with this, we have a duty, duties, the first of which is to speak frankly and clearly without doom-mongering," Macron continued, adding that France, Europe and the world had possibly been too "insouciant" about threats to democracy and human rights - while warning of the "rise of illiberal regimes and strengthening of authoritarian regimes."

**Tone deaf?**

According to the report, Philippe Martinez, the secretary general of the powerful CGT union criticized Macron's comments as being "misplaced" - adding that many French citizens have never known abundance.

"When we talk about the end of abundance, I think of the millions of unemployed, the millions of those in a precarious situation. For many French people, times are already hard, sacrifices have already been made," he said.

The economic newspaper Les Echos said the **dividend payout was almost 33% up on the previous year and was the result of a post-Covid economic catchup.***

During a commemoration ceremony for the allied invasion of Provence in 1944, Macron warned that **this autumn and winter would be a difficult one** - with the risk of energy shortages and high prices due to Russia's war on Ukraine - **which he referred to as "the price to pay for freedom."**
