## \[MIH\]: MOMENTS IN HISTORY

THIS EVENT QUALIFIES AS A UNIQUE MOMENT IN HISTORY.  NEVER HAVE I EVER SEEN WORLD LEADERS TELL THEIR CITIZENS THAT LIFE WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR 5 TO 10 YEARS.

THE ONLY OTHER TIME I HAVE POSSIBLY SEEN THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IS WHEN A COUNTRY IS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE.  THINK BAGHDAD BOB, AND EVEN THEN THEY WOULD SAY "EVERYTHINGS FINE"

THE FACT THAT THEY ARE FINALLY BEING HONEST SHOULD GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW BAD ITS GOING TO BE.

TRULY, A MOMENT IN HISTORY

THIS IS A LIVE JOURNAL OF LEADERS AS THEY CAPITULATE
